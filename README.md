# VeloCloud Edge 5X0 on OpenWrt 25.12 (kernel 6.12)

Stock OpenWrt 25.12.5 on the VeloCloud Edge 520 and Edge 540 (Intel Atom
C2000 "Rangeley" boards with two Marvell 88E6176 switches, two 88E1514 WAN
PHYs and two SFP cages), with a small, rebasable patch set instead of the
vendor's kernel fork.  Everything below is tested on an EDGE540 (C2558,
8 GB, fan) and an EDGE520 (C2358, 4 GB, fanless), both board rev 2.8.

Latest image: the newest `kernel-N` release on the
[releases page](https://github.com/gallops-gannets/velo540openwrt/releases).
Each carries a ready-to-write USB stick image (`openwrt-velo5x0-stick.img.gz`)
and the plain image for `sysupgrade`.

## Status

| | |
|---|---|
| LAN1-8 | **working**, per jack, as `lan1`..`lan8` under mainline DSA (mv88e6xxx); a plain two-dumb-switches mode is one command away |
| GE1 / GE2 (88E1514 behind I354) | **working** (`eth4` = WAN by default, `eth5`) |
| SFP1 / SFP2 (I354 SerDes, 1 Gbps only) | working (`eth2`, `eth3`) |
| USB 3 (TI TUSB7340) | working (`patches/220-*`, the controller needs a forced reset on 6.12) |
| WiFi (Atheros QCA988x mini-PCIe) | working (ath10k-ct) |
| Front logo RGB LED (PCA9634) | **working** as three OpenWrt LEDs `pca963x:{red,green,blue}:logo`, configurable in LuCI |
| Fan (EMC2104, Edge 540 only) | **working**: closed loop on the tach, off-at-idle band, tunable in `/etc/config/velo540` |
| TCO watchdog | working |
| Serial console | ttyS1, 115200 (the RJ45 console jack) |
| PoE | not populated on the tested units (no LTC4266 answers on any bus with its reset released); the control lines exist on PCA9557@0x1c pins 0/1 |
| Mini-PCIe slots | no USB on any slot: cellular modems must be USB devices |

## Installing on a stock Velo

1. Write the stick image to a USB stick (macOS shown; on Linux use `dd`):
   ```sh
   gunzip -c openwrt-velo5x0-stick.img.gz | sudo dd of=/dev/rdiskN bs=4m
   ```
2. Plug the stick into a **USB 2** socket (the black one; the blue USB 3
   sockets are dead until the OS is up), connect the console (115200) or a
   laptop on any LAN jack (the box's own network is 10.11.0.0/24), power on and pick the stick in the SeaBIOS boot
   menu (it sometimes needs a second Ctrl-Alt-Del before the stick is listed).
3. Log in (`root`, no password) at 10.11.0.1 or on the console and write
   the internal disk (the 7.6 GB USB disk, `sdb` when booted from the stick):
   ```sh
   wget -O /tmp/img.gz https://github.com/gallops-gannets/velo540openwrt/releases/download/kernel-N/openwrt-velo540-kernelbuild-ext4-combined.img.gz
   gunzip -c /tmp/img.gz | dd of=/dev/sdb bs=1M conv=fsync
   ```
   Then power off, remove the stick, power on.  Don't pull the stick while
   the box runs from it.
4. First boot: `velo540-dsa enable && reboot` for per-jack ports,
   `passwd`, and whatever else you need (Tailscale, WiFi, witness).

Later updates: `sysupgrade -v <image>.img.gz` from the running box keeps the
configuration.  Run it on the console or a foreground SSH session, not
backgrounded.

## Configuration knobs (all in `/etc/config/velo540`, kept across sysupgrade)

* **Switch mode**: `velo540-dsa enable|disable|status`.  DSA mode names the
  jacks `lan1`..`lan8` (measured map: LAN1=B1 LAN2=B0 LAN3=B3 LAN4=B2
  LAN5=A2 LAN6=A0 LAN7=A1 LAN8=A3; A = 00:14.0/eth0, B = 00:14.1/eth1).
  Unmanaged mode gives two 4-port dumb switches on `eth0` (LAN5-8) and `eth1`
  (LAN1-4).  Applied at boot by `velo540-switch` writing the glue module's
  `dsa_mask` parameter.
* **Fan** (`config fan`): `min_rpm`/`max_rpm` targets between `t_min` and
  `t_max`, `off_below`/`on_above` for an off-at-idle band, `tach auto|0`,
  `min_duty` for 2-wire fans.  The stock Sunon MF50101V1 (3-wire, voltage
  controlled by the board) cannot run below ~2700 RPM; a quiet replacement is
  the only way to a silent 540.  Fanless 520s skip the service.
* **Bad RAM pages** (`config memmap`, `list reserve '4K$0x...'`): re-applied
  to grub.cfg every boot by `velo540-memmap` (one tested 540 has a single
  weak cell that logs corrected ECC machine-checks).
* **Witness** (`config witness`): `list target 'name=ip'`, `period`, `fails`,
  `ntfy_url`, `pushover_token`/`pushover_user`.  Logs state changes, pages on
  down/recovered, lights the red logo LED while anything is down.
* **WiFi**: off by default; `velo540-wifi on|off|status`, and the failover hook
  brings it up while running on cellular.
* **Status JSON** for dashboards: `http://<box>/cgi-bin/status.json` (temps, fan,
  WAN/cellular, witness states, WiFi, LEDs); served on the LAN and Tailscale, and
  to the home LAN through firewall rule `velo_status_lan` if you add one.
* **Cellular** (`config cell`): `velo540-cell status|restart|test start|stop|bandlock on|off`,
  and `velo540-celltest yes` to measure (four receive chains under load, serving cell, throughput; ~600 MB of plan data per run, so it asks; `quick` is radio-only and free).
  Getting full speed out of a USB modem on this board needs three things, all now automatic:
  `ss_lpm_off '3-0:1.0/usb3-port1'` refuses USB3 U1/U2 on a named port at boot, and `velo540-modemdev -u` (run by the usb hotplug hook) refuses it on whichever SuperSpeed port the modem actually lands on, which is what
  actually caused the SuperSpeed reset storm we originally worked around by forcing USB 2
  (`ss_disable`, still available as a fallback); `kmod-rmnet` plus
  `option multiplex 'required'` on the `wwan` interface turns on QMAP aggregation; and
  `/etc/uci-defaults/60-velo540-mm-multiplex` teaches netifd's modemmanager proto the
  `multiplex` option and renames the mux link, since netifd reads the dot in `qmapmux0.0`
  as a VLAN tag and refuses it.  Measured on one RM520N-GL on 5G SA n41: 104 Mbps on USB 2
  unaggregated, 240-290 Mbps with all three.  Note `network.wwan.device` names the modem's
  sysfs path, which changes with the bus it enumerates on (`usb3/3-1`, not `usb1/1-1`).
  **Caveat — the multiplex patch is load bearing, and now we know why** (2026-09-19,
  ModemManager 1.24 debug log): the RM520N-GL's firmware default data format is QMAP v5
  aggregation.  For a plain bearer MM sets aggregation to "disabled" and then sends WDS
  Start Network, which the module never answers; the connect sits in "connecting" until
  the 120 s timeout.  With `multiplex=required` MM leaves QMAP v5 alone and the call
  completes in about 10 s.  Reproduced with the patched proto and `multiplex=none`, with
  the pristine stock proto (MM's default is none), and earlier on the board's own TI USB
  controller, so it is the module plus MM, not this patch or the USB path.  Upstream
  OpenWrt's proto (master, 2026-09) still has no multiplex option.  If the patch ever
  fails to apply after a sysupgrade it now logs at daemon.err and leaves
  `/etc/velo540-mm-multiplex.FAILED`; cellular will not come up until it is fixed.
  Upload is also far noisier than download on this link: 2-30 Mbps on a
  single stream and a steady 13-15 Mbps across six, against 240+ Mbps down, and it tracks
  which cell the modem is camped on rather than anything configurable here.
  `velo540-ttl` rewrites TTL/hop-limit to 65 on `wwan0` so forwarded traffic is not
  classed as tethering.  If the modem never shows an NR carrier, check
  `AT+QNWPREFCFG="nr5g_band"` on `/dev/ttyUSB3`: one unit shipped locked to n48
  only; setting the full list (`1:2:3:5:7:8:12:20:25:28:38:40:41:48:66:71:75:76:77:78:79`)
  is stored in modem NVRAM and gave 5G SA on n41.
  A mini-PCIe Renesas uPD720202 USB 3 card (kmod-usb-xhci-pci-renesas is in the image)
  replaces the board's TI TUSB7340 for the modem: 5 Gbps link, no resets, 199 Mbps on
  first measurement against 115 on USB 2 with a worse radio.  Adding it renumbers the USB
  buses (Renesas usb1/usb3, TI usb4/usb5); the hotplug hook handles the modem's path.
* **House-wide failover** (`/etc/uci-defaults/70-velo540-uplink`, spec in
  home-network-ops `docs/house-failover-spec.md`): GE2 (`eth5`) is `uplink2`, a /30 to a
  spare router port; traffic arriving on it is policy-routed to the cellular interface (table 100, a
  netifd route kept in step with `wwan`) whatever the box's own default is, and the
  cellular interface sits in its own `cell` zone with `uplink`→`cell` and `lan`→`cell`
  the only forwardings into it, so with cellular down house traffic is dropped rather
  than looped back out GE1 into the router's LAN.  CAKE (`sqm.cell`, needs kmod-sched-cake/kmod-ifb/sqm-scripts in the image)
  shapes `qmapmux00` itself with `diffserv4`; `velo540-ttl` also marks everything the
  box originates CS6 so management traffic (Tailscale, SSH, witness, PDU) rides above a
  bulk download.  cake-autorate (installed from GitHub into `/root/cake-autorate`, kept
  by sysupgrade.conf, needs bash + fping; its init script ships in the image because
  `/etc/init.d` is not preserved and the installer's copy vanished on the kernel-21
  upgrade) is started by `velo540-failover` only while the house is on cellular and
  stopped on recovery: its reflector pings follow the default route, so left running
  they would measure the fibre and cost ~3 GB/month.  "House on cellular" is detected
  from traffic on GE2 (more than `house_thr_bytes`, default 50 kB, per probe period in
  either direction; back after `house_idle_periods`, default 30 = 5 min, of quiet), NOT
  from this box's own probes, which keep answering through router → GE2 → cellular
  during a house failover.  The same state lights the blue logo LED and is `house` in
  status.json, with `cell_cycle_mb` (vnstat2) beside it.
  vnstat2 meters `qmapmux00` with the cycle rolling on the 7th, database in
  `/etc/vnstat`.  The router side (`cellwan` on its spare port, metric 50, and the
  `router-failover` tracker) lives in home-network-ops `provisioning/router/`.
* **Cellular measurement**: `velo540-celltest` (add `quick` to skip transfers) prints
  the four receive chains sampled under load, the serving cell and throughput.  Use it
  to score antenna moves: the chains should land within ~3 dB of each other with SINR
  above 10 dB.  A 4x4 module with its paddles screwed straight onto the carrier sits
  ~2 cm apart, well under the 6 cm half-wave at n41, so the chains correlate and only
  one or two spatial layers get through (measured: SINR -7/8/0/-4, 103 Mbps, against
  440 Mbps from a hotspot in the same spot on the same plan).  SMA extensions, ~15 cm
  spacing and alternating polarisation are the fix.
* **PDU** (`config pdu`): `velo540-pdu status|on|off|cycle <n|name>` drives a Dataprobe
  iBoot PDU8A-N15 on the box's LAN over its REST API; password in
  `/etc/velo540-pdu.secret` (mode 600, list it in `/etc/sysupgrade.conf`), outlet names
  as `list outlet 'router=1'`.  Two traps: the factory password is `admin` + the last
  three MAC octets, not `admin`; and its fail2ban (3 failures in 300 s) closes every TCP
  port for 300 s while ping still answers, so whitelist the box's own address on the PDU.
* **Antenna placement**: `https://<box>/antenna.html` (Start/Stop on the page, or
  `velo540-antenna start|stop`) shows all four receive chains live, strength and
  quality, refreshed about twice a second.  Start keeps a rate-limited download running
  (~1.2 MB/min) because the module only reports two chains when idle; it stops
  itself after 40 minutes.  Touch a paddle and watch which chain dips to learn
  which is which.
* **LEDs**: standard OpenWrt LED config (`/etc/config/system`); defaults are
  green steady = all good, red = the witness sees something down, blue = running on cellular (hotplug hook, WAN down and `wwan`/`cellular` up).

Notes: `tailscale0` belongs in the `lan` firewall zone (fw4 rejects tunnel
traffic otherwise); mwan3 must stay disabled until a second WAN exists (its
policy rules preempt Tailscale's table 52, and stopping it empties that
table: restart tailscaled).  A `tailscale` mwan3 rule is pre-seeded.

## What the patches and glue do

* `patches/200-igb-velocloud-edge5x0.patch`: igb detects the board (NVM
  words 6/7 = "Vc"/"5X"), forces the 1000/full SGMII link with no PHY on
  functions 0/1 and exports their MDIO masters as `igb-vc-0000:00:14.{0,1}`,
  and routes PHY access on functions 2/3 to the external bit-bang bus.
* `patches/210-mdio-gpio-clear-level-before-input.patch`: gpio-ich on Avoton
  ORs cached output levels into reads; drive the line low before turnaround.
* `patches/220-xhci-ti-tusb73x0-force-hcrst.patch`: force HCRST when the
  TUSB7340 refuses to halt.
* `patches/230-dsa-pdata-own-tree.patch`: let each platform-data DSA switch
  have its own tree, so both 88E6176 register.
* `package/velo540-glue`: two out-of-tree modules.  `vc-edge5x0-mdio`
  sets the GPIO mux bits, registers the bit-bang MDIO bus (SoC GPIO 13/14 rev
  B, 11/12 rev A) and the board I2C bus (GPIO 11/12, adapter `i2c-9`) that
  carries the PCA9557 expanders, EMC2104, PCA9634 and EEPROM, and hands the
  PCA9634 to `leds-pca963x` through software nodes.  `vc-edge5x0-dsa` creates
  the mv88e6xxx platform-data devices on the igb-vc buses (`dsa_mask`
  writable at runtime).
* `files/etc/init.d/velo540-switch`: at boot, brings the switch CPU SerDes
  links up (and, in unmanaged mode, PHYs and forwarding), resets the 88E1514s
  through PCA9557@0x18 and re-probes their igb functions, sets the WAN PHY
  LEDs, puts the fan controller in PWM mode and enables the logo LED outputs.
* `files/usr/sbin/velo540-fand`, `velo540-witness`, `velo540-dsa`,
  `files/etc/init.d/velo540-{fan,memmap,witness}`: see above.

Hardware facts come from the vendor's GPL tree (`vendor-patches-3.14/`,
mirror of the dead `bitbucket.org/velocloud/openwrt`): I354 func 0/1 →
switch A/B port 4 SerDes, SMI on the function's own MDIO pins, single-chip
addressing; func 2/3 → 88E1514 at addr 0/1 on the GPIO bus; switch ports
0-3 = jacks, 4 = CPU, 5/6 = unused RGMII cross-links.

## Building

`.github/workflows/kernel.yml` (push to the `kernel` branch, or dispatch)
runs `scripts/kernel-build.sh`: a full OpenWrt v25.12.5 build with the
patches in `target/linux/x86/patches-6.12`, the glue as a kmod package, the
`files/` overlay, a 6 GB rootfs, console on ttyS1, `acpi_enforce_resources=lax`,
and the package set (LuCI, ModemManager, mwan3, Tailscale, python3, ser2net,
collectd, ath10k, USB serial drivers, i2c/mdio tools).  Results go to a
`kernel-<n>` release, including the uniquely signed stick image.

`scripts/build.sh` (`build-<n>` releases) is the older SDK + ImageBuilder
path; its modules do not load on `kernel-N` images (different kernel
config), so it is only useful against stock release kernels.

All `kernel-N` images share one MBR disk signature; that is why the stick
image is re-signed, and why a stick and the internal disk must never carry
the same one (the kernel would mount the wrong rootfs by PARTUUID).

## Not done / ideas

* PoE (no PSE found on these units).
* PXE/TFTP server for recovering other machines from the closet.
* ser2net consoles for other devices (packages are in the image, nothing attached yet).
* House-wide failover commissioning (cable, dry run, enable, exercise) per the
  spec; mwan3 is in the image but must stay off.
* Replacement fan for the 540: Sunon MF50101V3-1000U-G99 or any quiet 50x10 mm
  12 V 2- or 3-wire fan, spliced onto the existing connector.
